# 🏀 NBA Performance Analysis – Machine Learning Project

This project uses NBA player data to build and evaluate a **Random Forest Regression model** to predict player performance. It was created as part of my data analytics learning journey using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

---

## 📌 Overview

- Cleaned and explored NBA player data  
- Identified key features that influence player performance  
- Built a Random Forest model to predict points per game  
- Evaluated the model's performance and visualized insights

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- pandas, NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 🧪 Process

1. **Data Cleaning** – handled missing values, renamed columns  
2. **Exploratory Analysis** – histograms, heatmaps, and correlations  
3. **Feature Engineering** – selected performance-related stats  
4. **Modeling** – Random Forest Regressor  
5. **Evaluation** – achieved **R² score of 0.87** on test data

---

## 📈 Results

- Model explained 87% of the variance in player performance  
- Most influential features: **minutes played, assists, and rebounds**  
- Helped visualize trends among top-performing NBA players
