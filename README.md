# ML Predictions â€“ Project Overview

ðŸ“Œ **Goal**: Build and evaluate a machine learning model to make predictions based on [briefly describe your dataset, e.g., customer data, housing prices, etc.].

ðŸ”§ **Tools Used**:
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- [Add any others: NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.]

ðŸ§  **Project Highlights**:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature selection and engineering
- Trained models using [e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.]
- Evaluated performance using metrics like [e.g., MAE, RÂ², accuracy]

ðŸ“ˆ **Outcome**:
Achieved a [describe result: high accuracy, good prediction score, etc.].  
Model insights were used to [real-world application if any].

ðŸ“‚ **Notebook**: See `ML predictions.ipynb` for full code and step-by-step workflow.
